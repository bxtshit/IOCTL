# IOCTL
IOCTL Driver for Valiant, (6/16/24.)
Terrible code, zero classes/optimization.
Should still work, I felt nice and updated the user-mode for latest update. (Fortnite 10/4/24)
Don't expect much, I would highly reccomend using a custom IoCreateDriver function, 
or just completely ridding the DeviceObject and DriverObject. (Nulling Page Frame Number/Null PFN)
